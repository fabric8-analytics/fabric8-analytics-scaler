# fabric8-analytics-worker-scaler
OpenShift service that scales fabric8-analytics workers based on number of messages in SQS.
This service directly uses `oc` command-line tool to scale the deployment.
This requires to have mounted service account inside the container.
`workerscaler` service account for that purpose by default. Definitions and role binding of the service account
are available in the [openshift/](openshift/) directory.


## Configuration

The service needs to be configured via environment variables.
The list of variables recognized by the service follows.

`DC_NAME`

Name of the deployment config to scale. Default value: `bayesian-worker-ingestion`

`DEFAULT_REPLICAS`

Default (minimum) number of replicas. Default value: `1`

`MAX_REPLICAS`

Max number of replicas. Default value: `2`

`SQS_QUEUE_NAME`

Name of the queue to monitor (without deployment prefix). Default value: `ingestion_bayesianFlow_v0,ingestion_bayesianPackageFlow_v0`

`OC_PROJECT`

Name of the project in OpenShift where to apply the changes. Default value: `bayesian-preview`

`SCALE_COEF`

Number of messages that singe worker is able to process, i.e. no need to spawn additional pods. Default value: `100`

`SLEEP_INTERVAL`

Interval, in minutes, how often to run the scaler. Default value: `5`

`DRY_RUN`

Run in dry-run mode, do not scale anything. Default value: `false`


The default values can be tweaked directly in the [template](openshift/template.yaml).
The values for specific deployments (staging, production) can be set
